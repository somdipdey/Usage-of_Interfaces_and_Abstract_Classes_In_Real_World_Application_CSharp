# C#: Usage of Interfaces and Abstract Classes in Real World (and Difference between The Two)

Recently I started job hunting (I hate job hunting btw) and many interviewers asked me the same question regardless of my experience in Software Engineering. First couple of times when I got asked that question, I felt little offended, yet I defended my honour of being an experienced Software Engineer and answered it correctly. Can you guess what that question is?
Well, it’s actually a two-part question as follows:

1)    "What are Interfaces and Abstract Classes?"

2)    "When and how to use them?"

Pretty basic question, yet this is one of the fundamental concepts of Object Oriented Programming. This made me reflect that why so many hiring managers were asking the same question, even to an experienced Software Engineer. Now, if we keep our engineering ego aside for the moment, and reflect that why hiring managers are asking this question, we can see there are actually many reasons behind it.

But one of the key reasons being, Interfaces and Abstract Classes are not just simple fundamental concepts in OOP but many software developers regardless of having experience in software development or not, can have a misconception regarding Interfaces and Abstract Classes, and how to use them.

This being said, I didn’t know the truth behind these two concepts till I started developing software as a professional myself. So if you are one of the developers who want to revise your knowledge or learn the truth behind these two concepts then follow along. We will try to figure this out using a real world software development scenario (almost real).
